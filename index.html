    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <div class="bio">
        <p>Mia Ruger was born in Boulder, CO in 2000. She grew up in her childhood home with her parents, older sister, and older brother. They spent a lot of time hiking, biking, and skiing in the sunny state. In 2008 they adopted their dog Ali. Ali was a rescue from Utah and also enjoyed hiking occasionally. After highschool Mia decided to go to college at Western Washington University. She was attracted to the skiing and biking she had heard about. She also wanted a change and thought the pacific northwest would be a great place to live. Although Bellingham is rainy and very different from sunny Boulder she still loves both places very much. Mia Ruger is currently pursuing a major in design and a minor in spanish at WWU. Although she is not sure what she wants to do after graduating she is excited for the future and what will come!</p>
